# Python Package for communication with Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

This package enables the communication with the simulation software product "Tecnomatix Plant Simulation" by
Siemens. It speaks to PlantSim via the COM interface from within Python and includes useful mappings for
some more complex PlantSim data types like tables.


## Example

```python
from plantsim.plantsim import Plantsim
from plantsim.table import Table

plantsim = Plantsim(version='15.2', license_type='Research')
plantsim.load_model('model.spp')
plantsim.set_path_context('.Context.In.Your.Model')
table = Table(plantsim, 'TableName')
print(table) 
```

An example, together with a simple simulation model, can be found in [example](example/).

## Setup

### Requirements

You need a working version of Tecnomatix Plant Simulation installed on your system to be able to use this package.


### System settings

If you have a NVIDIA 3D graphics card installed, make sure to select it as the default in the "NVIDIA Control Panel".
Otherwise when loading a model into Plant Simulation, you will get an information window that you need to manually
click every time.
